\section{Lessons Learned}\label{section5}

During the execution of the activities documented in this paper, the authors identified some situations in which works related to the concepts involved can benefit. As lessons learned we highlight:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain Characteristics:} a domain analysis can be considered one of the most important activities for the creation of an SPL. The evolution of the catalog of requirements proposed by Duarte Filho and Barbosa \cite{filho13} significantly contributed in terms of domain knowledge and supported the adoption of the proactive model for the development of M-SPLear\allowbreak ning.
    \item \textbf{Variabilities and M-Learning:} the use of the SMarty notation helps the identification of the variation points during the design of M-SPLear\allowbreak ning, ensuring greater cohesion for the implementation of the SPL components. It also contributes to the assimilation of the SPL concept. However, those involved must be trained so that the elements of notation can be used consistently.
    \item \textbf{M-SPLear\allowbreak ning Development:} the implementation of something generic and customizable is significantly different from a static approach. Therefore, developing features in an SPL requires a greater effort, which is justified by the subsequent gains of reuse.
    \item \textbf{M-SPLear\allowbreak ning Experimental Evaluation:} researches show that test executions in SPL are scarce and need to be evaluated and validated \cite{engstrom11}. Thus, the authors decided to apply the test cases in the products generated by the SPL, enabling a interesting comparison with an alternative methodology of development.
  
The experimental evaluation provided relevant results for the adoption of M-SPLear\allowbreak ning. The choice for active participants in the industry contributed to the reduction of the training session. However, experience and understanding the concepts by the participants is always difficult to measure.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the use of testing technics from traditional development process, new ways to test quickly software products from SPL needs more attention and research. One benefit in the adoption of SPL is about the improve of quality, since the products and their components are testing in several instantiations of products, leading to a quickly fix for the final client. Although the use of the components in a higher number of products and, for consequently, a bigger number of clients in SPL, the way that the components and products have been testing could be improved to be done in more aligned way with the SPL specificities. Literature reflects more concern to test the SPL architecture and fewer preoccupation to test the final components and products.

Singular development methodology difficult maintenance of the products, if the is no rigorous development process defined. As all developers tends to program in their own way, give supports for each product developed following each manner, in most of time, could take most time and cost more. If an SPL practice is adopted, and is rigorously followed, the cost and time to give support tend to decrease.

SPL needs mechanisms to allow a transparent and easy manner to reflect all updates in the core assets in the architecture, and vice versa, in other words, changes to the core assets require more efforts to maintain architectural integrity. Additional tools and analysis must be done to guarantee that all changes, in the architecture or in the components is reflecting all features and behaviors that the line have until that moment.
